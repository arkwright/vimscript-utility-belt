# Vimscript Utility Belt

Vimscript utility functions to make your life easy.

# Why?

I'm making a Vim plugin. I need functions. They don't exist. So I
write them.

But then maybe you need them. So I share them. Now we both have
functions!

# Not A Plugin

This is not a plugin. Do not install it via Pathogen or Vundle. If you
use any of these functions in your own plugin, *embed them into
that plugin*. Don't require your plugins' users to install this project
as a dependency.
